      <description>After starting to look more int GO programming I also inteded to revive my outdated blog on github. Although I&amp;rsquo;m veteran Pythonista I felt a little bit stuck with the complexity and the missing reactive designs of Nikola with which I started my blog.
Digging more into the Go ecosystem I stumpled across Hugo and played around for a night, and with my limited number of existing posts swichting was easily done.</description>

Example on how ASP.Net Core handles overwriting loaded array configuration when the later read config files contain less array entries than before.
