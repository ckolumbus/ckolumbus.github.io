After starting to look more int GO programming I also inteded to revive my outdated blog on github.
Although I'm veteran Pythonista I felt a little bit stuck with the complexity and the missing reactive designs of [Nikola][1]
with which I started my blog. 

Digging more into the Go ecosystem I stumpled across [Hugo][2] and played around for a night, and with my limited number
of existing posts swichting was easily done.

To whomever it concerns: here are my **ultimate reasons for switching**

* MUCH better selection of reactive themes
* less bloated configuration
* single executable (that's what I love about go in general)


**Drawbacks:**

* not such a nice gh-pages deploy integration
* not python ;-)
* creation of themes not that flexible (no theme inheritance)


That's my resumee for the time beeing, I've only scratched the very surface of Hugo yet and I'm curious what else I will found good and not-so-good about hugo.
